        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was one of the most prominent leaders in the Indian freedom struggle. 
            He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, and was a brilliant student who passed the Indian Civil Services Examination 
            but resigned from his position to fight for India's independence. Bose was a radical nationalist who believed that India's freedom 
            should be achieved through an armed struggle rather than peaceful negotiations.

        <p>
            During World War II, he sought the help of Axis powers to challenge British rule. He formed the Indian National Army (INA) 
            with the support of Japan and fought against British forces. His slogan "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom" 
            inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle for independence.

            Although he died in a plane crash on August 18, 1945, under mysterious circumstances, Netaji remains a revered figure 
            in India's history, symbolizing patriotism, courage, and the undying spirit of freedom.
